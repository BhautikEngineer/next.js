# next.js
Step 1: Install Next.js
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt. Then, run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

npx create-next-app my-next-app


Step 2: Create the "Hello, World!" Page
Next, navigate into the newly created project directory:
cd my-next-app

Inside the folder, edit a file called "page.js" with the following content:

/page.js

function HomePage() {

  return &lt;div&gt; Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;

}

export default HomePage;

Step 3: Test the Application
To make sure everything is working, run the development server:
npm run dev

Your Next.js application should now be running locally. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the "Hello, World!" message.
